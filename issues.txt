Issues to address

1. build.gradle

1.1 Properties to set based on value of iibEnv. Only need overrides.properties file?
1.2 Do we need the functionality to tansform junit XML report to HTML or can we expect TFS to do it? TFS 2015 R2 can import junit XML files.
1.3 Should soapui parameters be used to set Ant properties or should they be passed to ant masterbuild.xml file as macro substitutions?

2. masterbuild.xml

2.1 Should runTest be converted from a target to a macrodef?
2.2 Should the 'deploy' target be kept? If not, cascade to rid dependent targets
2.3 Should the 'cleanup' task be extended to delete *.class and *.jar files?
2.4 Should the test target be deleted?

3. build.xml

3.1 Should build.xml and masterbuild.xml be merged?
